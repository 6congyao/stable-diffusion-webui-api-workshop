# stable-diffusion-webui-api

This repo shows how to use stable-diffusion-webui to create Amazon SageMaker image for inference and training and how to generate images based on the combination with Stable-diffusion models and ControlNet / Lora models.

You will find 3 Jupyter Notebooks: 1 for sync ControlNet / Lora inference, 1 for async ControlNet / Lora inference, and 1 for Dreambooth training.
